# Assignment-2---Arthur-Volpato

For this assignment, I’ve used the iPhone accelerometer and the IBM Speech Recognition SDK for Unity, that for some reason didn’t quite work in the iPhone, so I demoed it in my laptop.

The accelerometer is used for controlling a machine gun in front of the house. The user can tilt the phone (left or right) and control the direction of the model in the X axis.

For the speech recognition, I’ve implemented simple actions to disable/hide/destroy the objects in the scene, when saying “stop shooting”, and “disappear”.
